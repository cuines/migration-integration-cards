# Evidence-Based Event Cards for Migration Policy Scenario Game

## Project Overview

This repository contains a set of evidence-based "event cards" developed for the EU Policy Lab's **Scenario Exploration System (SES)** board game. The cards are directly informed by research findings from the **CHILD-UP project**, which investigates the integration and social conditions of migrant children in Europe.

### Purpose

The primary goal is to bridge the gap between academic research and practical policy-making. By systematically converting CHILD-UP findings into tangible, playable policy challenges, we create a powerful tool for workshops, stakeholder discussions, and policy simulations. These cards help participants understand the nuanced realities of migrant children's integration and test plausible policy responses in different future scenarios.

### Repository Structure

- `README.md` – This file, explaining the project.
- `card_template.md` – Template for creating new event cards.
- `cards/` – Folder containing individual card files (e.g., `card-001-language-barrier.md`).
- `issues/` – Folder linking research findings to card development (optional).
- `releases/` – Archived versions of the card set.

### How to Use

1. **Review the card template** to understand the required fields.
2. **Browse the cards** to see how CHILD‑UP insights have been turned into game events.
3. **Use the cards in a SES workshop** – each card presents a scenario trigger, a description based on real research, and a policy dilemma for players to debate.
4. **Contribute** by opening an issue with a new research finding or proposing improvements to existing cards.

### Linking to CHILD‑UP Research

Each card explicitly references a key insight from the CHILD‑UP project. The source documents and reports can be accessed via the [CHILD‑UP website](https://www.child-up.eu/). The translation of research into game components ensures that policy discussions are grounded in empirical evidence.
