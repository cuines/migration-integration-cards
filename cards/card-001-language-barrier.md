# Event Card 001: Language Barrier in Segregated Schools

**Card ID:** 001

**Title:** Language Barrier in Segregated Schools

**Scenario Trigger:** Educational Policy Shift

**Description:** Ten years from now, a new wave of migration has led to the creation of separate "transition schools" for newly arrived children. While intended to provide intensive language support, these schools have become isolated from the mainstream education system. Teachers report that students in these schools rarely interact with native speakers, slowing their language acquisition and social integration. Parents are growing concerned that their children are being left behind, and local communities are starting to question the effectiveness of the separation policy.

**Key Insight from CHILD‑UP:** "Segregated educational settings, even when designed to offer targeted support, can inadvertently reinforce language barriers and limit opportunities for meaningful intercultural contact." (CHILD‑UP Final Report, 2023, p. 45) – Based on case studies from Germany, Italy, and Sweden.

**Policy Dilemma for Players:** As policy makers, you must decide how to address the growing language gap. Choose one of the following options:

1. **Merge transition schools with mainstream schools** – risking short‑term disruption but promoting long‑term integration.
2. **Double down on specialised language programmes within the segregated system** – maintaining stability but potentially deepening social divides.
3. **Create mixed extracurricular activities and buddy systems** – a middle‑ground approach that fosters interaction without immediate structural change.

**Suggested Game Effects (align with SES scoring):**
- Option 1 (Merge): –2 Budget, +1 Social Cohesion after 2 rounds.
- Option 2 (Specialised programmes): +1 Public Support immediately, –1 Social Cohesion after 3 rounds.
- Option 3 (Mixed activities): –1 Budget, +1 Intercultural Trust immediately, no change to Social Cohesion.
