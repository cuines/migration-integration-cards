# Event Card Template

Use this template to create a new evidence-based event card for the EU Policy Lab's Scenario Exploration System.

## Fields

### Card ID:
A unique identifier for the card, e.g., `001`, `002`. Follows the pattern `card-XXX`.

### Title:
A short, descriptive title that captures the essence of the event.

### Scenario Trigger:
The type of scenario in which this event would appear. Choose from:
- **Educational Policy Shift**
- **Community Tension Event**
- **Legal/Administrative Change**
- **Economic Pressure**
- **Health & Wellbeing Crisis**
- **Cultural Integration Challenge**
- **Family Dynamics & Support**
- **Media & Public Discourse**

### Description:
A narrative paragraph that sets the scene for players. Describe the event as if it were happening in the game’s fictional future (10 years from now). The description should be engaging, plausible, and grounded in the CHILD‑UP research finding.

### Key Insight from CHILD‑UP:
A direct quote or concise summary of the relevant CHILD‑UP finding. Include a citation (author, year, page if available) and, if possible, a link to the source document.

### Policy Dilemma for Players:
A clear, open‑ended question or a multiple‑choice prompt that challenges players to decide on a policy response. The dilemma should reflect the trade‑offs and uncertainties present in the real‑world situation.

### Suggested Game Effects (Optional):
If you wish to propose specific game mechanics (e.g., “Lose 2 Policy Cohesion points,” “Gain 1 Public Support token”), note them here. This helps game facilitators adapt the card to the SES rules.

## Example (Filled Template)

**Card ID:** 001

**Title:** Language Barrier in Segregated Schools

**Scenario Trigger:** Educational Policy Shift

**Description:** Ten years from now, a new wave of migration has led to the creation of separate “transition schools” for newly arrived children. While intended to provide intensive language support, these schools have become isolated from the mainstream education system. Teachers report that students in these schools rarely interact with native speakers, slowing their language acquisition and social integration. Parents are growing concerned that their children are being left behind.

**Key Insight from CHILD‑UP:** “Segregated educational settings, even when designed to offer targeted support, can inadvertently reinforce language barriers and limit opportunities for meaningful intercultural contact.” (CHILD‑UP Final Report, 2023, p. 45)

**Policy Dilemma for Players:** Should the government invest in merging transition schools with mainstream schools (risking short‑term disruption but promoting long‑term integration), or should it double down on specialised language programmes within the segregated system (maintaining stability but potentially deepening social divides)?

**Suggested Game Effects:** 
- If players choose merging: –2 Budget, +1 Social Cohesion after 2 rounds.
- If players choose specialised programmes: +1 Public Support immediately, –1 Social Cohesion after 3 rounds.
